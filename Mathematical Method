The maths behind the cryptosystem.
====================================


1. First, a superincreasing sequence w is created. This is the basis for a private key. From this, calculate the sum.

2. Then, choose a number q that is greater than the sum.

3. Also, choose a number r that is in the range [1, q) and is coprime to q.

4. The private key consists of q, w and r.

5. To calculate a public key, generate the sequence β by multiplying each element in w by r mod q. The sequence β makes up the public key.

Say you want to encrypt "a". First convert "a" to binary. Then multiply each respective bit by the corresponding number in β.
